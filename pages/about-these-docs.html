				<h1>Introduction</h1>
				Hellos.

				Thousands of hours have gone into technical documentation for IC Realtime products.  Hundreds of products have been developed, and hundreds of people have helped contribute, test, develop, debug, and document these devices across various mediums.  Spreadsheets, matrices, tables, documents, web sites, and even software applications have been developed to inform, educate, enlighten, support, and in general: imnprove the quality of life for Users and Technicians of our products alike.
				<p> <br>
				This KnowledgeBase exists to connect the dots.  To bridge the gap between the efforts of hundreds of people, over thousands of hours.  To integrate the integrable, and to enlighten those who are willing to search.
