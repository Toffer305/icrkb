				<h2>International Protection Rating Code (IP Code)</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>The IP Code classifies and rates the degrees of protection against the instruction of solid objects. (including body parts like hands and fingers), dust, accidental contact, and water in mechanical casings and with electrical enclosures.</p>
				<p>The IP Code is rated by the two numbers based on the following chart.</p>

								 The equipment is suitable for continuous immersion in water under conditions which shall be specified by the manufacturer. Normally, this will mean that the equipment is hermetically sealed.
